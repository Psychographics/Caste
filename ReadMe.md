## Basics
- A Trading Card Game (T.C.G.) with an emphasis on a caste system and an environment magic system in a constant state of flux, different magic castes that determine how you play cards on the board and a unique card acquisition system that is based on accomplishing raids and challenges to acquire key items and cards which can only be otherwise acquired through PvP combat.

Some cards and effects are limited to certain castes.

### Castes

Lore: They are considered the purest magic tapping into the source itself to perform their magic.

### There will be six castes of caster split into two groups.

#### Unassisted Magic (Hereditary, Highborn, More respected)

Psions (Telepathy & Mind Control)
- clairvoyance/premonition (the ability to predict the player's next card)

Evokers
- Magic that manipulates energy or creates something seemingly from nothing. An evocation specialist is called an evoker. They are technically opening portals in the same realm or to the many realms to produce what they need 

Enchanters
- Magics that imbue the recipient with some property or grant the caster power over another being. An enchantment specialist is called an enchanter. (Can switch over units "to and fro", buff and debuff units, buff and debuff player characters)

#### Assisted magic ( A matter of choice or career, Lowborn, Less respected )

Theurges
- One who persuades a god or spirit to perform a supernatural work.

Druids
- Ability: Spirit Animal
- Have pets that fight or have status effects(i.e. buffs and debuffs)
- improved animal empathy and buffs on animal minions 

Artificers/Creators (***The only class that can create CARDS) 
- Create and use magic items and only use magic items (can only use items)
- Come in types Alchemists, Forgers and Technomancers

### Dark Alternates
Season 2 Will be SIEGE where dark type casters e.g  Infernal Magic, Necromancers, Sacrifice/Blood casters  etc
Players will be seduced by the power of the dark side the more dark cards they use in their deck the more the darkness spreads and the stats will determine who wins or losses depending on dark or light magic 

#### Unassisted magic "The turned" (Hereditary, High Status, More feared )
    
Psions (Telepathy & Mind Control)
- Mind Control (Force your hand. Can force you to play a different card from the intended play)
- Hypnosis (Alter opposition player state)
- Everytime mind control is caste can back fire and cause a reverse premonition. (See good psions for premonition)

Hex Mage
- Destroy life and use life energy to play and empower cards (Can summon cards using their hp points and for every 3points of destroyed monsters they can get +1 points to summon)
- Enchant and Disenchant cards using their own life force

#### Assisted magic (Choice, Low Status, Less feared)
Infernal Magic
- One who persuades an infernal entity to perform a supernatural task.
- Because they summon extraplanar entities with their own nefarious plans every time a card is cast there is a chance that this card with unbind itself fron the caster and escape for good leaving the board and deck permanently potentially freeing all copies of the same card at the same time
- (*mechanic 1:1000 chance of escape on casting, but if a card successfully escapes there is a 1:2 chance of it liberating all of its copies from your grimoire).

Beast Master Class 
- Ability: Beast Companion
- Can tame and summon monsters and beasts with unique monster abilities

- Desecrated items make carry a small curse with them 


#### Totems
Totem - Interactable cosmetic Pets/Artifacts used to represent the caste, strength and prestige of a player 
- We will have a Plinth in the bottom left hand corner of the board for them.
- Totems will hold class abilities that can be activated once per turn if the conditions are met.
- Totem cosmetics will be a purchasable item in the shop.

#### Phases
- Each round play will alternate between two or more (tbd) players in timed phases. Each player is given 60secs to execute their plays, if the player fails to complete their play they are given a 10sec grace period which is deducted from their next round.
- We are investigating a initiative based gameplay system.

### Environment Magic

Battle Ground Effects (BGEs)
 
 - The board starts off in a neutral ground state after which players can change the state of the board by playing spell cards or playing cards with ground status effects.

 - Once the ground state has been changed from neutral to any other state the new state permanently affects the ground for the rest of the battle, any other state change will be stacked with previous states e.g. if a player activates the higher ground effect (makes footing uneven to the advantage of the caster, gives +1 attack and defense to friendly summoned units) if the opponent plays the same card it does not neutralise the first player's card it just gives him the same status effect in this case +1 on attack and defense to friendly summoned units. Battle Ground Effects gained as a result of a summoned unit's passive effects will not be permanent unless explicitly stated in the summoned unit's description. In summary Battle Ground Effects stack. 

 - Once the ground state has been changed from neutral to any other state the new state permanently affects the ground for the rest of the battle, any other state change will be added onto the previous states e.g. if a player activates the higher ground effect (makes footing uneven to the advantage of the caster, gives +3 attack and defense to friendly summoned units), if the opponent plays the same card it will first neutralise the first player's card and then a second higher ground card will give them the same status effect in this case +3 on attack and defense to friendly summoned units. Battle Ground Effects gained as a result of a summoned unit's passive effects will stack with active effects but will not be permanent unless explicitly stated in the summoned unit's description. In summary Battle Ground Effects stack.

 - BGEs have a multiplying effect limited to 1x, 2x and 3x its effect on units. Stacking multiple BGEs will strengthen the effect to a maximum of 3x.

 - ##### Some examples of battle ground effects
    - Mounted Attack, Higher Ground and Great Walls give +1, +2 and +3 attack and defense to friendly summoned units and associated effects
    - Misted Fields, Sudden Rain and Flash Floods give +1, +2 and +3 to water type units and associated effects
    - Sun Struck, Scorched Earth and Byzantine Fire give +1, +2 and +3 to fire type units and associated effects
    - Whirlwinds, Scirocco and Hurricane give +1, +2 and +3 to air type units and associated effects
    - In Our Element, Ley Lined, Mana Storm give +1, +2 and +3 to pure magic damage
    - Hallowed Ground will Consecrate the board and remove all prevailing BGEs (in future expansions it may add +1 to Light) Costs +2
    - Mass Grave will Desecrate the board and buff all prevailing BGEs (in future expansions it may add +1 to Dark) Cost +2
    - Fog of War all cards on your side of the board are shrouded in darkness until attacked.

    Different combinations of BGEs can create new or different BGEs with different or enhanced buffs and debuffs e.g. 
    - Flash Floods and Winter Winds can create Blizzard which gives -1 to water type units
    - Flash Floods and Desert Winds can create Hurricane which gives -1 to fire type units
    - Casting 2 Higher Grounds gives (+1 x 2) to all friendly summoned units.

## Cards & Card Collection

### Cards
Each card will have a cost equivalent to the amount of damage it can deal on attack and how many defense points it has
e.g. A card with 2 Atk and 2 Def will cost 2 to place so each point of Atk or Def Costs O.5 rounded up
So a card that has 3 Atk and 1 def will cost 2, conversely a card with 1 Atk and 5 Def will cost 3.
This rule extends to magic dmg, every 2 points of magic dmg will cost 1. For BGEs every buff/debuff point will cost 1.
Except for BGEs every spell/effect will cost 0.5 (pending further evaluation).

Each card has an elemental affinity the gets buffed or debuffed based on the balance of nature.

Players vote on cards to be accepted in each season. They will also vote on what cards to remove from the play into Wild Cards. 

Cards can be played at the cost of Life/HP, Energy/Vitality, Gold/Money or Spirit/Mana

Keep a ledger of Card ownership, track legendary cards and player driven mythologies around items.

#### Card Properties
Cards will hold several properties
- Id
- Card Name
- Card Animations
- Card Artwork
- Card Biography
    - Card Biographies have a max of 200 characters.
- Card Effects
- Card Element
- Card Class
- Card Status

- Psions (Telekinetics & Telepathy)
- Evokers
- Enchanters
- Theurges/Diviners
- Druids
- Artificers/Creators

#### Card Sub-Classes
Cards classes can have specialisations i.e. subclasses

#### Card Status
Cards have different status determining if they are playable in competitive or are wildcards and have been retired to casual play.
- Playable

#### Card Collection
Each season will see a new selection of cards being added to the compendium. To acquire cards players must complete raids and battle NPCs to acquire loot in the form of new cards, magics, items etc.

Some raids and challenges will come and go depending on the season and some will be permanent additions. Some loot will have a limited drop amount (making the items unique and limited edition) and or a decreasing drop percentage over time.

Some raids and challenges will drop items specific to a caste. Giving players the chance to win any item within the caste's compendium.

The raid mechanic will allow for a multiplayer experience.

A battlepass will allow players access to seasonal raids and challenges.

Another way to gain specific new cards will be to take part in the arena. Players will wager a specific card and battle another player with a card they may want to add to their collection the winner will take both cards.

## Look and Feel

## Look

### Battleground/Board/Planes
Battlegrounds are the visual representation of the planes (i.e. the planes is the virtual environment used to limit the real world effect of the Caste). The Battleground will consist of 10 individual sections split into two. One side for each player.
Battleground sections
- The Deck Area: Will hold a player's Grimoire.
- The Staging Area: Will hold all of the players cards that are in hand and have not yet been played.
- The Plinth Area: Will hold a player's class Totem/Artifact/Pet.
- The Playfield Area: Will hold the player's cards currently in play.
- The Graveyard Area: Will hold all of the player's card that have been removed from play.

The backdrop of the board is the battleground represented in realtime. 

### Cards/Spells
Cards are a live representation of a real thing or action in reality therefore they should look and feel alive. Some cards will have voice acting and animation (more gif style animation etc.).

### Grimoire/Spellbook
Grimoires will hold all of the player's cards in a given deck. The contents of said grimoire can be changed and grimoires can be swapped out in the player's library. The grimoire is the player's avatar and game companion.
- Grimoires Are Sentient: They have personality. Grimoires will play along with Casters in a assistive manner (think a golfer and golf caddy relationship) and provide cards in an almost thoughful manner (Card selection will still be completely random though). 
- Grimoires Have A Voice: They have an active voice and quippy dialogue which accentuates their personality. Most in game narratives will come from the perspective of the grimoire.
- Grimoires Look and Feel Alive: Grimoires are living documents. They will be bound in live jackets that relate to the grimoire's personality and player's caste. They will also be visually active with period animations, animated icons and effects when interacted with.
- Grimoires Are The Player's Avatar: There should be context clues of a player's caste (e.g. Druids and Beast Masters will have pets their on the grimoires jackets), play style, competency level, aesthetic preferences and personality given by seeing and hearing the players grimoire.  

### Totems
Totem - Interactable cosmetic Pets/Artifacts used to represent the caste, strength and prestige of a player 
- We will have a Plinth in the bottom left hand corner of the board for them.
- Totems will hold class abilities that can be activated once per turn if the conditions are met.
- Totem cosmetics will be a purchasable item in the shop.

## Feel

### Cards
Cards have a weight based on cost and this weight should be felt when the cards are played. When heavy weight cards are played the board should shake to tremors and the card's realtime effect on the planes. 

### Game Progression
As the game progress the visual and sound effect should bring about a sense of urgency. Effects and animtions should become more exagarated.

## Lore

### The world
Caste is set on Kaisimi a world that is powered by magic. All aspects of life are driven by and facilitated by mana the source of all magic and by extension life. Centuries ago a great strife (the Sundering) fell upon Kaisimi, long arduous battles where fought and many souls lost in a quest to establish dominance over this world and amongst the casualties was Kaisimi herself. In Kaisimian kinds lust for power they had tried to harness even more of Kaisimi's mana which failed and triggered a series of events which syphoned Kaisimi's power into the great unknown and left her dying a slow and painful death. To prevent this cataclysmic event, it was hoped that if the use of her remaining mana was limited to the absolute bare mininum and other alternatives where employed they could maybe delay the end by a few millenia and a find a more permanent way to return that which was lost.  
And so the Caste was born, six castes were devised to restrict the use of pure/wild magic. These castes based on the six vices and virtues, would employ the methods once used to only amplify Kaisimi's magic as their primary source of power. In addition no more battles would be fought in earnst but instead all disputes would be handled by the Caste.  
The Caste being a competition that would be fought on the Planes a simulated realm with the full effect of battle but saving both parties from senseless carnage and using only microfractions of the magic that would have been wasted, but the result still being bound on this plane as well as any other in the many realms.

### The six virtues and vices
Compassion - Indifference (Psions)  
Creation - ReCreation/Destruction (Evokers/Necromancers)  
Assistance - Manipulation (Enchanters/Hex Mages)  
Truth - Deception (Theurges/Summoners)  
Protection - Domination (Druids/Beast Masters)  
Generosity - Greed (Artificers/Desecrators)

### Castes
- Psions (Telepathy & Mind Control): Can create illusions, baffle, stun and take control of hostile units and read opponents hands.  
Lore: Have inherited their abilities from the MindFlayers themselves. After years of study and experimentation the first Psions managed to alter their being to mimic the abilities of the Mindflayers and have since passed down these abilities by bloodline. This the purest of the classes as it uses the least mana and can only be attained through specific bloodlines and lends itself well to "leadership". Psions are the only Caste that was created in Vice and not in Virtue, the Mindflayer may read your pain but it is indifferent to your suffering. The Psions were a dark caste for a long time until cooler heads prevailed and moved them towards Compassion.

- Evokers (Use Mana): Can use intention to magic things into existence from what "LOOKs" like nothing.  
Lore: We peered into the dark for sooo long it felt as if it had begun to peer back and out of it came wonders. Spurred by the pain of need the first Evokers reached into their minds and out into Many Realms and "CREATED" that which they needed. This Caste is also passed down from generation to generation but less so through blood and more so through familial affinity and tutelage in an art that can only be mastered from infancy. The Evoker's title of Creators has long been in disputed by Artificers who believe Evokers do not create anything but rather they pilfer it from other parts of the many realms by creating extraplanar portals to that which they desire.  
Necromancers: Can return units from the grave. Not being satisfied with just creating anew, Necromancers destroy what is given and replace it with that which has moved on.

- Enchanters : Masters of the Written Magic can enchant weapons, items and themselves using runes and the written magic. Bards fall into this class through the Sung Word.  
Lore: The build their magic from the Wisdom of Old can tap into ancient forgotten arts preserved in runes. This class is made up of the families wise enough to preserve power through the written word and continue to do so through secrecy and literacy.  
Hex Mages: While Enchanters empower, imbue and assist, Hex mages disrupt, drain and manipulate by exploiting the Wisdom of Old. 

- Theurges (Borrow power from extraplanar beings): Specialise in healing, can control elementals, control the elements and blessed items.  
Lore: Access their powers from different sources to perform magic. They tap into the Sentient of the many realms and petition for help but as we all known in this realm as in the others nothing is ever given for free. This help is offered in return for service and is bound by trust. Anyone can access this source as long as they are committed and truthful.  
Summoners: Summoners acquire extraplanar retainers through elaborate schemes, trickery and cleverly worded contracts which would not normally work were it not for the implied trust of physical presence and the retainer's ability to champion their own cause in any realm.    

- Druids (Use Nature's Energy): Can use, buff and control natural flora and fauna as part of their energy.  
Lore: After centuries in the wild lands they established a symbiosis with nature and are now one with it. Druidic abilities were earned by those who were once considered the lower races this heightened their empathy for the abused and down trodden and initiated their now unbreakable connection with their surroundings and the sentience without a voice.  
Beast Masters: Beast Masters narrowed their focus down to the more destructive elements of their surroundings and exploit these creatures not as equals but as masters, removing the once deep connection to the other elements of the natural world. 

- Artificers/Creators : The artificers can create, summon and manipulate magic items to carry out tasks and battle. This caste is made up of engineers,artists, blacksmiths etc. and is plied as a trade.  
Lore: They tie their art to the creation of the Universe itself the true masterwork and the tap into this same source for their power. Believe in the God Forge and that Kaisimi herself was created by the Artificers who left behind the God Forge, a forge that can be used to create the Masterwork and ultimately save or destroy the world as they see fit! They are a low order/worker class but they believe they should be ruling class. They are collectively known as The Guild.  
Desecrators: Desecrators seek more power from tools and items by altering them from the initial purpose and intent of their original creators. Instead of creating their own.

### Wild Magic
Theres a group in the world known as wild mages the use the untamed magic without regard to its cost and effect breaking all the rules of the caste system. A lot of the magic they use is based on magic long abandonded before the caste because of the magic cost, leaving very few who know the right way to cast such magic and the associated effects. These people use wild cards and are banished to fringes of polite society. lol...
